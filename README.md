# SelfAnchoring

Cleaning and Analyses for research investigating how people project self-perceptions onto their ingroup using relational similarity and contrast-based mechanisms.

Design: Self-evaluate on 90 traits. Then classify each trait as typical of ingroup or outgroup.

Study 1: Minimal groups... Randomly assign to overestimator or underestimator group.

Study 2: University of California Riverside Students (Ingroup) against UCLA (higher status), CSU LA (lower status), or Not UCLA (Negation/Control)

Study 3: Minority vs. Majority. Asian or Latino students exclusively recruited and compared against either Latino or Asian (respectively) or White.
